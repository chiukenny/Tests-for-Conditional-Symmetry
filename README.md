# Randomization Tests for Conditional Group Symmetry

This repository contains the code used to generate the experiment results discussed in the article [Randomization Tests for Conditional Group Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14391), which supersedes the article [Non-parametric Hypothesis Tests for Distributional Group Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15834). The repository for the previous article can be found [here](https://github.com/chiukenny/Tests-for-Distributional-Symmetry).

* To run one of the demo files, execute the command `julia <demo_file>.jl` in the command line.
* To run one of the experiments described in the paper, see the file `run_experiments.jl` for instructions.
